    p Things you should know:
      ul
        li Theres 1 strength upgrade in each world, plus one more randomly placed (unless you chose the other option).
        li Wall clips are not necessary, although it is randomly possible to wall clip out of the lower right hand corner in 3-4 and skip the boss 
        li The logic for maps, torches, and pencils are inverted so that if you don't have them, you'll get their benefit.  This is to aid you in the randomized fortresses.  If you buy one, they'll stop working
        li some screens look weird because of palette/spritemap differences
        li All prices are adjusted way down because those shop keepers were too greedy
        li All vanilla Kid Icarus passwords should work (unless you're using race mode)
        li This is a beta, so bugs are likely, if you find any, or want to provide feedback message Rumbleminze on discord (Rumbleminze#7132)
